Reinforcement learning - learning by trial and error

Characteristics of RL:

There is no supervisor, only a reward signal
Feedback is delayed, not instantaneous (=> reward may be delayed)
Time really matters
Agent’s action affects the subsequent data it receives, actions may have long term consequences

Elements of RL:

RL is about what to achieve
Maps situations (states) to actions -... to maximize a reward
The learner (agent) is not told which actions to take ... but must discover which actions yield the most reward
An agent receives the systems state and a reward signal
A reward is a scalar feedback signal and indicates how well an agent is doing at step t
The system makes a transition to a new state and the cycle is repeated

Q-learning:
Learning the model on the fly! nO prior knowledge is required!

OpenAI - ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) — highly autonomous systems
that outperform humans at most economically valuable work — benefits all of humanity.
Will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider mission
fulfilled if work aids others to achieve this outcome

Gym - toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. Supports
teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like Pong or Pinball
