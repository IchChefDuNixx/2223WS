Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an exploratory approach to reduce the data set's
dimensionality to 2D or 3D, used in exploratory data analysis for making predictive models.
Principal Component Analysis is a linear transformation of data set that defines a new
coordinate rule such that:
The highest variance by any projection of the data set maps to the first axis.
The second biggest variance on the second axis, and so on.


Variance**page 17
Eigenvalues:
We have used squared sum , e.g. ss1 and ss2, of the distances of the projected points to
the origin
This can be converted to variation by dividing by the sample size minus 1 (n-1)
and
Example:
PC1 = 15 and PC2 = 3 => total variation is PC1+PC2 = 18
PC1 accounts fr 15/18=0.83= 83% of the total variation
PC2 accounts for 3/18=0.17= 17%
var1 = ss2/n − 1 ; var2 = ss2/n − 1

Covariance Properties 1/2 page 21
Because the covariance matrix is symmetric, the eigenvectors are orthogonal to each
other.
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors come in pairs. Such a pair is known as an eigenpair. The
number of eigenpairs is equal to the number of rows or columns in the covariance matrix.
For example, in a 4 x 4 covariance matrix, there are 4 eigenvalues and 4 eigenvectors.
The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix represent the principal components (directions
of maximum variance).
The eigenvalues of the covariance matrix define the magnitude of eigenvectors. To get the
top eigenvectors, we have to sort the eigenvalues in descending order.
The amount of variance explained by an eigenvector can be obtained by getting the ratio
(fraction) between the corresponding eigenvalue and the sum of all eigenvalues.
The covariance matrix of standardized data is almost equal to the correlation matrix of the
non-standardized, original data.
The diagonal in the covariance matrix of standardized data always contains 1s.
The sum of all eigenvalues of the covariance matrix is equal to the sum of the diagonal
elements in the covariance matrix.


Eigenvectors
The eigenvectors V represent the directions of the largest variance of the data
The eigenvalues represent the magnitude of this variance in those directions.
