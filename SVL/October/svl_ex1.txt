1a finding the mapping between x and y (in, out)
b finding patterns in data (eg yt recos)
c exploration/exploitation, rewarding good behaviour, punishing bad behaviour, sits between environment and agent

2a measuring and placing objects into the feature space
b choice of hypothesis class of real world problem
c updating parameters in model function

3a choice of hypothesis space, data acquisition, feature subset selection, optimization procedure, performance measure
b predicting a random number. genereally hard when there is no pattern
c a higher bias results in a stronger resilience to outliers. modeling higher dimension models increases the variance
there is a sweet spot between bias and variance. going to an extreme is bad
d there doesn't exist a function that works best for everything. mulitple problems may require different solutions
